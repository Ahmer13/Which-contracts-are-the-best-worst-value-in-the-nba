# Salary Hoops Score 🏀💰

After the blockbuster Luka Dončić trade, I found myself wondering: are teams actually getting good value for the money they spend on star players? That sparked the idea behind this project — to build a dashboard that measures how efficiently NBA players perform relative to their salaries.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze the relationship between player performance and salary
- Identify underpaid and overpaid players across the league
- Help visualize how teams manage salary cap value
- Provide tools to explore value by team, position, and age

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Win Shares per $1M Salary**
- **Points per $1M**
- **PER vs. Salary Percentile**
- **Overall Value Rank**

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Lovable (interactive dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook (data prep + analysis)
- GitHub (version control + portfolio)

## 🔍 Features (Planned or In Progress)

- KPI cards: Best value player, most overpaid, top-value team
- Filters by **team**, **position**, and **age range**
- Charts: Scatter plot (performance vs. salary), bar charts, histograms
- Insight section with key takeaways for analysts or GMs

## 📁 Structure

- `/data`: salary and stats files (from Spotrac & Basketball-Reference)
- `/notebooks`: analysis notebooks
- `/app`: dashboard deployment (planned)

## 🚀 Why This Project?

As someone who loves both sports and analytics, this project blends two of my biggest interests. It also sharpens skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling — all of which I use in my professional work as a business/data analyst.

## 📌 Status

Currently merging datasets and cleaning player names. Dashboard build in progress!
